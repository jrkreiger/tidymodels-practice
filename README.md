# Tidymodels Practice
Practice projects with R and tidymodels

The projects in this folder are based on the tutorials for tidymodels available at [https://www.tidymodels.org/](https://www.tidymodels.org/). In some cases, I diverge from the tutorial to analyze datasets or try techniques of particular interest to me.

In **tidymodels_tutorial_1.R**, I substituted [a dataset about health insurance costs found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).

This is a work in progress. Check back occasionally for updates.
